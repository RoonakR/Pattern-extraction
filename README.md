# Pattern_Extraction

We introduce a pattern extraction method which uses both the Lagrangian Multiplier and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to create patterns from raw sensory data. We have evaluated our method by applying a clustering method on constructed patterns. The results show that by using our proposed Lagrangian-based pattern extraction method, the existing clustering algorithms perform more accurately - by
up to 20% higher compared with the state-of-the-art methods, especially in dealing with dynamic real-world data.
